    - Public List - things they want and are looking for
    - Secret List - things they want but don't explicity say


Customer AI:
    - While public list is incomplete:
        - Pick an unseen square adjacent to a seen square walk to it
        - If target item is in your line of sight, stop what you're doing and grab it
    - Once public list is complete:
        - Find the exit and leave

Dynamics:
- Certain Items are often bought together (Eggs + Milk, Eggs + Bread, Eggs + Flour)
- Certain Items are popular on public lists (Eggs, Milk, Butter, Bread)
- Certain Items are popular on secret lists (chocolate, candy)
