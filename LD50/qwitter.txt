Maybe just like redo the whole rendering system as components??

Posting screen

Reactions to post screen

Disagree with post

Users have teams that dictate their reaction

Follower Count

---

- Scroll (to a page of random posts)
- Agree with a post
- Disagree with a post
- Post about a Topic (hashtag)
- Post about a User (person)

> If you post things that people agree with, you get more Followers
> If you post something people disagree with, you lose Followers
> Each User has a "Team" that dictates their opinion on Topics

Each post has an Emotion attached to it
    - Laughing
    - Happy
    - Sad
    - Meh
    - Angry (gets the most engagement)

When a new Topic happens, Users pick a side based on what Team they're on.
    Each Team gets assigned an emotion, but some emotions are left out (ie: no one is mad about #Potatoes)
    If you react in alignment with a team, that team will like your post and follow you
    If you reach out of alignment with a team, members of that team are likely to unfollow you

Sometimes a Person becomes a Topic, but otherwise they function exactly the same
    This is just so you get Main Character'd at the end

> When you make a Post, you see the reactions come in
    > Gives you a sense of how effective the post was
    > If you Post about a Topic that's been around for a while, there isn't much engagement
    > Likewise, posting about a topic shortly after it becomes relevant gets lots of engagement
